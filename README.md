## Custom Changes ðŸŽ¨

- Added a new section `Skills` showcasing the technologies and frameworks I have been used, with their svg icons.
- Customized the section `Projects` with cool hovering effects. Also, clicking on the card redirects to its github repo.
- Added a video mp4 and converted into webp format for optimization. Integrated some Javascript to play the video when user hovers over it. The video stops when user does not hover over it.
